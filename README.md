# SubjectHeadingExpander
A command line utility for automatically expanding a prefix into subject headings and getting information about the subject headings from Libris (a national Swedish library search service). 
The utility is very easy to use:

- It accepts only one argument - the subject prefix to expand.
- The subject prefix must be at least 2 characters long.
